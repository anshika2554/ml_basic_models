# 🤖 ML Basic Models Collection

Welcome to this repository containing a suite of foundational **machine learning models** implemented using Python and scikit-learn. This collection is aimed at helping you understand, implement, and evaluate core ML algorithms — especially those commonly encountered in real-world applications and academic learning.

## 🧠 Introduction to Machine Learning

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn patterns from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed. It is broadly categorized into:

- **Supervised Learning** – where the model learns from labeled data.
- **Unsupervised Learning** – where the model finds structure in unlabeled data.
- **Reinforcement Learning** – where the model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

This repository focuses on **supervised learning**, showcasing both **regression** and **classification** models, along with techniques to evaluate their performance.
